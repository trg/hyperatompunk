# hyperatompunk - No Flickering Version

> Atompunk HyperTerm theme adding RGB shifting, tab text-borders, and CRT effect.  This branch does not have the flicker effect (which is visually interesting but somewhat distracting to me after a while)

## Install

Add `hyperatompunk` to the plugins list in your `~/.hyperterm.js` config file, but point to this git repo + branch directly.

This was originally a fork of [hyperpunk](https://github.com/staltz/hyperpunk) by [Andre Staltz](https://staltz.com).

CSS for the CRT effect comes from [CSS CRT screen effect](https://codepen.io/lbebber/pen/XJRdrV/) by Lucas Bebber.
